Quantitative Finance projects

This repository contains self-directed coding projects I have written to prepare me for a job in quantitative finance.

Most of these projects are inspired by Mark Joshi's excellent "The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance".

calloptionpricing, putoptionpricing and digitalcalloptionpricing are Python code I wrote to price and compute the Greeks of call, put and digital call options. This is initially done analytically, then checked via Monte-Carlo and finite difference methods respectively.
